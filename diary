I traveled with my family to one of the European countries, because my father used to work in this country. There I felt lonely. It is a cruel feeling, there are no friends and you cannot communicate with others. I longed a lot for my country, my friends and relatives. I missed our home and my school. I missed everything in home. Therefore, I asked my father to return to our homeland as soon as possible

I realized how much I love my country when I traveled to France to work this summer vacation. a I miss my family and friends. I miss my countryâ€™s air and sun. I used to call my friends every day, chatting with them and getting my country news.

The favor of the homeland over me is great, and no matter how much I work for my country, I will not fulfill its right, for it is the one in which my ancestors lived, and I was born in it and inhaled its air, and played in its streets, and learned in its schools, and in it the most beautiful memories of my life.
